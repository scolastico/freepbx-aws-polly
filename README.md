## About
This is a FreePBX TTS Engine for AWS Polly. It is based on the
[FreePBX TTS Engine](https://www.thewebmachine.net/wiki/freepbx-general/installing-aws-polly-tts-better-picotts-alternative) from [The Web Machine](https://www.thewebmachine.net/).
I updated the code to work with the aws sdk v3 (as v2 is no
longer supported), packaged it with a 'new' version of nodejs
(16) and added some new features.

### Just want to use it?
See the **step-by-step guide** in the **[wiki](https://github.com/scolastico/freepbx-aws-polly/wiki)**.

## Features
- [x] AWS Polly TTS Engine

## Installation
*For beginners: see the **step-by-step guide** in the **[wiki](https://github.com/scolastico/freepbx-aws-polly/wiki)**.*

Login to your FreePBX Server and run the following command:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scolastico/freepbx-aws-polly/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Configuration
After the installation you can configure the
`/opt/scolastico/freepbx-aws-polly/config.json` file.

See the [`defaultConfig.json`](./src/defaultConfig.json) for reference.

You can find the available voices [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html).

You should create a IAM user with the following
permissions:
```json

    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1234567890",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "polly:SynthesizeSpeech"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## FreePBX Configuration

in the FreePBX GUI.

## Usage
If you want to use a different voice or language you can use a `!<presets as csv>`
before your text. You can chain multiple presets which will overwrite already set
variables For example:
```bash
!en Hello World!
```
or
```bash
!de,2-seconds-silence Hello World!
```

## Troubleshooting
If something does not seem to work, check the log files:

```bash
tail -f /opt/scolastico/freepbx-aws-polly/logs/combined.log
```

If this does not help, you are always welcome to open an
[issue](https://github.com/scolastico/freepbx-aws-polly/issues).

## Update
Just run the [installation](#installation) again.

## Development
You need to install the following packages:
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm lame
```

Then install the dependencies:
```bash
